# Availability language

Restrict module and section access based on user language.

## Idea

Language filters are great, but sometimes they can make your resources and activities very complex. 
This availability condition makes it easy to show an English resource only to English users and an
activity in French only to French speaking students.

This plugin only pops up when

1. There is more than 1 language installed in the system (obvious, we need a least 2 languages installed
   to restrict)
2. When the language of the course is NOT forced. (Course - Edit settings - Appearance - Force language).
   When a course has a forced language, everything will be shown in this language and we are certain no
   user will ever arrive with another language enabled. On that moment there is no need to show the
   restriction, as it would only create the illusion that people could be restricted.

## Conditional availability conditions

Check the global documentation about conditional availability conditions:
   https://docs.moodle.org/en/Conditional_activities_settings

## Warning

* This plugin is 100% open source and has NOT been tested in Moodle Workplace, Totara, or any other proprietary software system. As long as the latter do not reward plugin developers, you can use this plugin only in 100% open source environments.
* The Moodle Mobile app relies on the user profile language and/or course language to show or hide a resource: the language selected in the app does NOT prevail.
